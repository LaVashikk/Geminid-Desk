    A powerful, feature-rich desktop client for Google's Gemini Models.
</h2>
</div>

Gemini GUI is a user-friendly interface to chat with Google's powerful Gemini models directly from your desktop. Forked from the excellent [Ellama](https://github.com/zeozeozeo/ellama) project, it swaps the Ollama backend for the official Gemini API and introduces significant UI/UX enhancements.

> [!WARNING]
> **Project Deprecated / Unmaintained**
> This project is no longer actively developed. The quality of Gemini models has noticeably degraded, Google completely shut down Google Code Assist on June 20, 2026, and they still haven't managed to make their official web interface less terrible. Feel free to fork, but don't expect new updates :)

# Features

- **Direct Gemini API Integration**: No need for local inference engines. Just bring your own Google AI Studio API key and start chatting.
- **Full Multimodality**: Leverage the vision capabilities of Gemini. Effortlessly chat about images, audio, videos, and documents by simply dropping them into the app.
- **Advanced Model Control**: Fine-tune your experience with detailed settings for each chat, including temperature, Top-P, Top-K, system prompts, and enabling Gemini's native "thinking" process for improved reasoning.
- **Complete Chat History**: Create, delete, and edit model settings on a per-chat basis. Your conversations are saved locally for you to continue anytime.
- **Resource Efficient**: Built with Rust and `egui`, the application has minimal RAM and CPU usage, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Your API Key, Your Data**: Your conversations go directly to the Google API using your key. There are no intermediary servers or subscriptions.

# Quickstart

1.  Download the latest release from the **[Releases](https://github.com/LaVashikk/gemini-egui/releases)** page.
2.  Go to the **Settings ⚙️** tab and enter your **Google AI Studio API Key**. This is required to communicate with the Gemini API.
3.  In the same tab, select a default model (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`) that will be used for new chats.
4.  Close the Settings tab, create a new chat by pressing the "**➕ New Chat**" button, and start your conversation!
5.  To add files (images, videos, etc.), click the **➕** button next to the text field or simply **drag and drop** them onto the application window.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Gemini GUI is built with the `tts` (Text-to-Speech) feature OFF. If you need TTS, build with `cargo build --features tts`.
>
> Note that on Linux, this requires `libspeechd` (`libspeechd-dev`) to be installed.
